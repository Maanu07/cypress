### Key Points
 - A basic intro to e2e testing with Cypress.
 - Cypress is generally used to write e2e tests, but we can also write component tests with Cypress.
 - The Cypress tests run on the actual browser instead of JSDOM, like with jest.
 - To run the Cypress UI locally, run the `npx cypress open` command.
 - We have also added a github workflow to run the cypress tests automatically when a pull request is made against main branch or a branch is merged into main.
 - Also scheduled the same job to run at 10:10 PM IST everyday.
